# Image Loading Fix for Desktop Version

## Problem
Images (especially icons) were not loading in the desktop version of the app built via GitHub Actions. This happened because the icon files were stored in the root `icons/` folder instead of the `public/icons/` folder.

## Root Cause
In Tauri desktop apps, static assets need to be in the `public/` directory to be properly bundled during the build process. The Vite build system copies everything from `public/` to the `dist/` folder, which Tauri then bundles into the desktop app.

When assets are outside the `public/` folder:
- ✅ They work in development (dev server can access them)
- ❌ They fail in production builds (not included in the bundle)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved Icons to Public Folder
Copied all icon files from `icons/` to `public/icons/`:
- `financeQuest_Icon.png`
- `achievement-quest-icon.png`
- `daily-quest-icon.png`
- `icon.png`
- `icons.png`
- And other icon files

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration
Modified `vite.config.ts` to:
- Explicitly set `publicDir: 'public'`
- Added image file extensions to `assetsInclude` (png, jpg, jpeg, svg, webp)

### 3. Code References (No Changes Needed)
All existing code already uses the correct path format:
```tsx
<img src="/icons/financeQuest_Icon.png" />
```

This path automatically resolves to `public/icons/financeQuest_Icon.png` during the build.

## Testing the Fix

### Local Build Test
```bash
# Build the app locally
npm run tauri build

# The executable will be in:
# src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

### GitHub Actions Build
After pushing these changes, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Run `vite build` which copies `public/` contents to `dist/`
2. Run `tauri build` which bundles `dist/` into the desktop app
3. Images will now be included in the final artifact

## File Structure
```
FinanceQuest_Campus-Edition/
├── icons/                    # Original icons (for reference/source)
│   └── *.png
├── public/                   # Assets for runtime
│   ├── icons/               # ✅ Icons used by the app
│   │   └── *.png
│   └── *.mp3                # Audio files
├── src/
│   └── components/
│       └── *.tsx            # References /icons/*.png
└── vite.config.ts           # Configured to bundle public/
```

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. **Always put runtime assets in `public/`** - Any file your app needs at runtime
2. **Use absolute paths starting with `/`** - e.g., `/icons/image.png`
3. **Test production builds** - `npm run tauri build` before releasing
4. **Keep root `icons/` for source files only** - Use for app icon, splash screens, etc.

## Related Files Changed
- ✅ `public/icons/` - Added icon files
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Updated configuration
- ℹ️ `src/App.tsx` - Already using correct paths
- ℹ️ `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Already using correct paths

## Verification Checklist
After deploying this fix, verify:
- [ ] Download artifact from GitHub Actions
- [ ] Install the desktop app
- [ ] Check that the FinanceQuest logo appears in the header
- [ ] Check that quest icons appear (daily quest, achievement quest)
- [ ] Verify no broken image icons in the app
