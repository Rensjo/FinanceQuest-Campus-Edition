# Contributing to FinanceQuest

First off, thank you for considering contributing to FinanceQuest! üéâ

This is a student-focused, gamified budgeting app, and we welcome contributions that help make financial literacy more accessible and fun.

---

## üéØ Project Philosophy

1. **Students first**: Features should solve real problems for university students and young professionals
2. **Privacy matters**: Local-first, offline-capable, no tracking without consent
3. **Gamification that educates**: Rewards should teach good financial habits
4. **Accessible by default**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, clear copy

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- (Optional) Rust for desktop builds

### Setup
```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Practice-Repo.git
cd FinanceQuest_Campus-Edition

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Examples:
# - feature/recurring-transactions
# - fix/csv-export-bug
# - docs/update-quickstart
```

### 2. Make Changes
- Follow existing code style (TypeScript, React hooks, Tailwind)
- Keep components small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update types in `src/types.ts` if needed

### 3. Test Locally
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` - no console errors
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Check keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Verify state persists on reload

### 4. Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add recurring transaction rules"
```

**Commit Convention** (optional but appreciated):
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation
- `style:` formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` code restructure
- `test:` adding tests
- `chore:` maintenance

### 5. Push & PR
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
Then open a Pull Request on GitHub.

## üé® Code Style

### TypeScript
```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good
interface Props {
  amount: number;
  onSave: (amount: number) => void;
}

export default function Component({ amount, onSave }: Props) {
  return <div>{amount}</div>;
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
export default function Component(props: any) { ... }
```

### Zustand Actions
```ts
// ‚úÖ Good
addTransaction: (t) => set((s) => ({
  transactions: [t, ...s.transactions],
  game: awardXP(s.game, 5)
}))

// ‚ùå Avoid mutating state
addTransaction: (t) => set((s) => {
  s.transactions.push(t); // Don't!
})
```

### Tailwind
```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good (use design system)
<div className="card">
  <button className="btn">Click</button>
</div>

// ‚ùå Avoid inline styles
<div style={{ background: '#000' }}>
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
For now, we rely on manual testing:
1. Test your feature in the browser
2. Check mobile view (responsive)
3. Test keyboard navigation
4. Reload page (state should persist)

### Future: Automated Tests
We plan to add:
- Vitest for unit tests
- Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests

Contributions welcome!

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

**Before opening an issue:**
1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/Rensjo/Practice-Repo/issues)
2. Try the latest version (`git pull origin main`)
3. Clear browser cache/localStorage

**Good bug report includes:**
- What you expected
- What happened instead
- Steps to reproduce
- Browser/OS version
- Console errors (if any)

**Example:**
```
Title: Safe-to-Spend shows wrong color

Expected: Green when STS > 0
Actual: Shows red even with positive STS

Steps:
1. Add transaction
2. Check dashboard STS widget
3. Color is red despite ‚Ç±500 remaining

Browser: Chrome 120, Windows 11
Console: No errors
```

## üí° Feature Requests

We love new ideas! When suggesting features:

1. **Check the roadmap** in [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md)
2. **Explain the problem** you're solving
3. **Describe your solution** (mockups welcome!)
4. **Consider alternatives** (are there other ways?)
5. **Think about complexity** (MVP vs. v1.0 vs. future)

**Good feature request:**
```
Title: Add bulk transaction editing

Problem: Correcting multiple transactions is tedious
Solution: Checkbox select + bulk actions (delete, re-categorize)
Alternatives: Edit modal with prev/next buttons
Complexity: Medium (2-3 days)
Priority: Nice-to-have for v1.1
```
