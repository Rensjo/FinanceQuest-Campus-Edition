## 🎯 How Daily Quest Selection Works

### Random Daily Selection
- **3-4 quests** are randomly selected each day from the pool of 16
- Provides variety and prevents repetition
- New quests generated at midnight
- Previous day's quests expire automatically

### Quest Categories
- 💸 **Spending** - Track expenses, manage budget
- 💰 **Saving** - Income logging, thrifty behavior
- 📄 **Bills** - Bill awareness and payments
- 🎯 **Goals** - Savings goal contributions
- 📊 **Insights** - Financial awareness

## ✨ Bill Awareness Quest - Now Properly Tracked!

### **Previous Behavior:**
- Would complete as soon as component loaded
- No actual user interaction required

### **NEW Behavior:** ✅
- **Only completes when user clicks/views the Bills section**
- Tracked via `trackSectionView('bills')` function
- One completion per day maximum
- Encourages actual engagement with bills

### How It Works:
1. User navigates to Bills & Payments section
2. `BillsSection` component triggers `trackSectionView('bills')`
3. System checks if already viewed today
4. If not viewed, marks quest as complete and awards rewards
5. If already viewed today, no action taken

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Features Added

#### 1. **Section View Tracking System**
```typescript
// In types.ts - Added to Gamification interface
dailySectionViews: {
  bills?: string;      // ISO date of last view
  envelopes?: string;
  insights?: string;
  goals?: string;
}
```

#### 2. **trackSectionView Function**
- Located in `src/store/budget.ts`
- Tracks when user views specific sections
- Prevents double-counting (one per day per section)
- Auto-completes relevant daily quests
- Awards XP and coins instantly

#### 3. **BillsSection Integration**
- Added `useEffect` hook to track section view on mount
- Calls `trackSectionView('bills')` when component loads
- Only happens when user actually navigates to the section

### Quest Completion Flow

```
User Action → Section Loads → trackSectionView() →
Check if viewed today → If not, complete quest →
Award XP + Coins → Update quest status
```
