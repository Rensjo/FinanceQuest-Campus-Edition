# Monthly Budget Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Integrated Monthly Budget with "Left to Spend" Widget**

The "Left to Spend" widget in the MonthlyOverview component now:

- **Uses configured monthly budget** instead of envelope totals
- Shows a **"Budget Configured"** badge when user has set up monthly budget sources
- Calculates spending against the **total monthly budget** from all enabled sources
- Updates the formula: `Left to Spend = Total Monthly Budget - Total Spent`
- **Color-coded status**:
  - 🟢 **Emerald** - 30%+ remaining (healthy)
  - 🟡 **Amber** - 10-30% remaining (caution)
  - 🔴 **Rose** - <10% remaining (critical)

#### New Features in Left to Spend Widget:
- **Progress bar** showing spending percentage
- Label updates to "Monthly Budget" when configured
- Dynamic color based on remaining budget percentage
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 2. **Repositioned Monthly Budget Widget**

Moved the Monthly Budget configuration section to appear:
- ✅ **After** Monthly Overview (with Left to Spend)
- ✅ **Before** Quick Add Transaction
- This creates a logical flow: View → Configure → Act

### 3. **Widget Order (Top to Bottom)**

```
1. Epic Header (Logo, Month, XP, Streak)
2. Monthly Overview (Left to Spend, Budget vs Actual, Breakdown)
3. 💰 Monthly Budget Configuration ← NEW POSITION
4. ⚡ Quick Add Transaction
5. Cash Flow
6. Bills Section
7. Budget Envelopes
8. Savings Goals
9. Quests
10. Shop
```

## How It Works

### Calculation Flow:

1. **User configures budget sources**:
   - Example: ₱1,000/week allowance + ₱8,000/biweekly income
   - System calculates: ₱4,330 + ₱17,360 = **₱21,690/month**

2. **System tracks spending**:
   - Monitors all envelope spending
   - Example: Food ₱2,000, Transport ₱800, etc.
   - Total spent: **₱5,500**

3. **Left to Spend calculation**:
   - ₱21,690 (budget) - ₱5,500 (spent) = **₱16,190 left**
   - Percentage: 25% spent, **75% remaining** ✅

4. **Visual feedback**:
   - Large number with color coding
   - Progress bar showing 25% filled
   - "Budget Configured" badge
   - Breakdown showing budget vs spent

## User Benefits
