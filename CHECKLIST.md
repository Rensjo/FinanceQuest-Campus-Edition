## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Hot Reload Works**: Edit any file → save → see changes instantly
2. **State is Persistent**: Clear localStorage to reset data
3. **Mobile First**: Test on small screens early
4. **Read the Code**: Components are small and well-commented
5. **Check IMPLEMENTATION.md**: See what's done vs. what's next

## 🐛 Known Minor Issues

1. ❗ **Streaks don't increment** - Display only, logic in v1.0
2. ❗ **Quests don't auto-complete** - Manual for now
3. ⚠️ **Long names overflow** - Add text truncation
4. ⚠️ **No mobile menu** - Desktop nav works, mobile could be better

**None block MVP testing!**
