# Monthly Data Isolation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented complete data isolation between months to ensure each month has its own unique transaction history and envelope balances. When switching between months, the system automatically archives current month data and restores or creates fresh data for the target month.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Store Architecture (src/store/budget.ts)**

#### Added Lifetime Counters for Gamification
```typescript
// In types.ts - Gamification interface
lifetimeExpenses: number;
lifetimeBillPayments: number;
lifetimeGoalsCompleted: number;
```

These counters persist across all months to track badge progress accurately, since badges represent lifetime achievements, not monthly progress.

#### Enhanced `switchToMonth` Function
- **Archives current month** before switching (transactions + envelope balances)
- **Restores historical data** if switching to a previously visited month
- **Creates fresh state** if switching to a new month (empty transactions, reset envelope balances)
- **Preserves gamification state** (quests, badges, XP, level, streak) across all months

#### Updated Transaction Tracking
```typescript
// addTransaction now increments lifetime counters
if (txn.type === 'expense') {
  game = { ...game, lifetimeExpenses: game.lifetimeExpenses + 1 };
}
if (txn.note?.includes('Bill payment')) {
  game = { ...game, lifetimeBillPayments: game.lifetimeBillPayments + 1 };
}
```

#### Updated Badge Calculation
```typescript
// checkAndAwardBadges now uses lifetime counters instead of current month transactions
if (badge.id.includes('expense')) {
  currentProgress = s.game.lifetimeExpenses; // Lifetime, not current month
}
```

### 2. **Component Updates**

#### Removed Date Filtering
Components no longer need to filter transactions by date since `transactions` array now only contains the current month's data:

**MonthlyOverview.tsx**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Filtered by date
const selectedMonthTransactions = transactions.filter(t => isSelectedMonth(t.date));

// AFTER: Use all transactions (already filtered by store)
const selectedMonthExpenses = transactions.filter(t => t.type === 'expense')...
```

**CashFlow.tsx / GeneralAnalytics.tsx**
```typescript
// BEFORE: 
const thisMonthTransactions = transactions.filter(t => {
  const tDate = new Date(t.date);
  return tDate >= startOfMonth && tDate <= endOfMonth;
});

// AFTER:
// Note: transactions array now only contains data for the currently selected month
const actualIncomeTransactions = transactions.filter(t => t.type === 'income')...
```

### 3. **UI Improvements**

#### Fixed Month Navigator Year Panel
Changed from `absolute` to `fixed` positioning to prevent it from being constrained by parent container's overflow:

**MonthNavigator.tsx**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
className="absolute top-full mt-2 left-0 right-0 z-50..."

// AFTER:
className="fixed z-[70]..."
style={{
  top: '50%',
  left: '50%',
  transform: 'translate(-50%, -50%)',
  width: 'calc(100% - 2rem)',
  maxWidth: '400px'
}}
```

Now the year selection panel appears centered on screen with a backdrop blur, not constrained by header container.

## Data Flow

### When Switching Months:

1. **Archive Current Month**
   ```typescript
   const currentMonthData = {
     monthKey: "2025-10",
     transactions: [...current transactions],
     envelopeBalances: { "food": 2500, "transport": 1000, ... }
   };
   monthlyHistory.push(currentMonthData);
   ```

2. **Load Target Month**
   - If exists in history → Restore transactions and envelope balances
   - If new month → Empty transactions, reset envelope balances to monthlyBudget

3. **Preserve Global State**
   - Quests (daily/achievements)
   - Badges and progress
   - XP, level, coins, streak
   - Goals (saved amounts persist)
   - Bills (schedule and amounts persist)
   - Budget configuration

### What Persists vs. What Resets:

| Data Type | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Transactions** | ✅ Isolated per month |
| **Envelope Balances** | ✅ Isolated per month (reset to monthlyBudget for new months) |
| **Goals** | ✅ Persist across months (saved amounts carry over) |
| **Bills/Recurring** | ✅ Persist across months |
| **Budget Sources** | ✅ Persist across months |
| **Gamification** | ✅ Persist across months (XP, level, streak, badges, quests) |
| **Lifetime Counters** | ✅ Persist across months (for badge progress) |

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Historical Data**: Each month maintains its own complete transaction history
2. **Clean Month Transitions**: Starting a new month gives fresh balances without manual reset
3. **Historical Analysis**: Can revisit any past month to see exactly what happened
4. **Gamification Continuity**: Quest progress, badges, and achievements work correctly across months
5. **Budget Tracking**: Can compare spending patterns month-over-month accurately

## Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ Switch between months and verify transactions don't carry over
2. ✅ Add transactions in Month A, switch to Month B, verify Month A transactions don't appear
3. ✅ Switch back to Month A, verify all original transactions are restored
4. ✅ Complete quests/badges and verify they persist when switching months
5. ✅ Verify envelope balances reset correctly for new months
6. ✅ Verify year panel appears correctly when clicking month selector

## Technical Notes

- Uses Zustand persist middleware to save `monthlyHistory` array to localStorage
- Month keys are in "YYYY-MM" format for consistent sorting and comparison
- Automatic switching triggered by `useEffect` watching `selectedDate` in Dashboard
- All date filtering removed from components for better performance
- Lifetime counters ensure badge system works across month boundaries
